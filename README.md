### 🛠 Tool Used: Microsoft Power BI  
### 📊 Dataset Source: Multiple Google Trends APIs (Country Wise, Date Wise, Related Keywords)  
---

## 📘 Introduction

The **Dynamic Google Trends Dashboard** is a Power BI project that transforms **raw search interest data** about global **job-related concerns**—such as “gender pay gap,” “job stress,” and “work-life balance”—into **interactive business intelligence**.  

Designed with **dynamic functionality**, this dashboard allows users to **instantly switch between different job concern topics**, automatically updating every visual across all pages. Through powerful integrations with multiple Google Trends APIs, it delivers **geographic**, **temporal**, and **contextual** insights into public sentiment surrounding workplace issues.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Visualize geographic interest** for each concern (e.g., percentage of searches for *“work-life balance”* by country).  
2. **Enable dynamic topic switching** using Power BI parameters—change the focus from *“gender pay gap”* to *“employee discrimination”* in one click.  
3. **Analyze temporal evolution** of job concerns using a dynamic **date-axis slicer** (Year, Quarter, or Month view).  
4. **Identify related and rising search terms** using keyword API feeds for contextual understanding.
